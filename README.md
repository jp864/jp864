# 👋 Hello! I'm João Rodrigues

## ♾️ About Me

I'm a self-taught technologist with a lifelong passion for computers and software development:

- **Early beginnings**: Started at age 5 on a hand-me-down 2005 "Square Generic" PC, tinkering with *SuperTux*.  
- **Creative growth**: By eight, I was playing Counter-Strike, learning Photoshop to create graphics—and even monetizing my designs.  
- **Multimedia skills**: Taught myself video editing to produce content for YouTube, including video game highlight reels.  
- **AI & automation**: Recently leveraged AI-driven tools to spin up websites for dropshipping, crypto ventures, and other side projects.  
- **Current focus**: At 21, wrapping up my IT degree, diving deep into C programming and exploring low-level systems.

I love turning ideas into working software and continually expanding my toolkit.
