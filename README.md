## ♾️ About Me

I’m a self‑taught technologist with a lifelong passion for computers:

- **Early beginnings**: Started at age 5 on a hand‑me‑down 2005 “Square Generic” PC, tinkering with SuperTux.  
- **Creative growth**: By eight, I was playing Counter‑Strike, learning Photoshop to craft graphics—and even monetizing my designs.  
- **Multimedia skills**: Taught myself video editing to produce polished CS:GO and other videogame highlight videos.  
- **AI & automation**: Recently leveraged AI‑driven tools to spin up websites for dropshipping, crypto ventures, and other side projects.  
- **Current focus**: At 21 and wrapping up my IT degree, I’m diving into C programming and exploring low‑level systems.  

I love turning ideas into working software and continually expanding my toolkit.
